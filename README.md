**Goal: reduce opponents HP to 0**

## Starting the Game
Both players start with 75 HP (can’t be exceeded)
Combine all move cards of each fighter to create your deck & then shuffle it to create your draw pile.

## Playing the Game

**New round:** Each player draws five cards after all effects are triggered in turn order.

**Player turn:** Players take turns playing a card. If opponent can’t play a card their turn is skipped, if both players can’t play their cards a new round will start.

**Playing cards:** To play a card draw it to the center, the card can only be played if player has enough energy (card cost is in the top left corner). When stealing: player gets the amount that was actually stolen. Playing a card ends the turn.
  
**Discarding cards:** To discard a card drag it to the bottom or top of the screen. Discarding will gain the player the card cost as energy and doesn’t end the turn unless it’s the last card.

**Effects:** Players can only have up to 5 effects & can’t have more than 5 blank cards. Effects are stacked & become more powerful (effect value * amount).

**Blank cards:** Blank cards are added to the player's draw pile and shuffled. The draw pile is also shuffled when removing blank cards from itself.
  
**Special Cards:** Block & take cards can only played as a response to another played card.

**Empty draw pile:** Cards are removed from stack and are returned to the players shuffled.

## End of Game
The game is over when a player has given up or has no health left.
